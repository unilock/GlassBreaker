# Glass Breaker

Usually glass breaks at a fixed speed, no matter what tool you use.

This changes that, so glass can now be broken faster with a pickaxe, as if it were any other block.

List of what the game considers "glass" blocks:
* Glass blocks + panes + stained variants (duh)
* Glowstone
* Redstone Lamps (1.20+)
* Sea Lanterns
* Beacons
* Conduits

Compatible with:
* Efficiency, Silk Touch, etc.
* Any mod that adds pickaxes, including pickaxe-like tools, like [Pickle Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/pickle-tweaks)' paxels.
* Any mod that adds glass, like [Glassential](https://modrinth.com/mod/glassential)!

(in all honesty it works in a kinda-hacky way but it should be fine ;) )

*(if you're looking for a vanilla-compatible datapack equivalent, check out [Pickaxe Effective Glass](https://modrinth.com/datapack/purpurpacks-pickaxe-effective-glass)! note, however, that it only works with vanilla glass, due to the limits of the vanilla datapack system.)*
