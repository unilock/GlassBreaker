# Glass Breaker

Usually glass breaks at a fixed speed, no matter what tool you use.

This changes that, so glass can now be broken faster with a pickaxe, as if it were any other block.

List of what the game considers "glass" blocks:
- Glass blocks + panes + stained variants (duh)
- Glowstone
- Sea Lanterns
- Beacons
- Conduits

Compatible with:
- Efficiency, Silk Touch, etc.
- Any mod that adds pickaxes, including pickaxe-like tools, like [Pickle Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/pickle-tweaks)' paxels.
- Any mod that adds glass, like [Glassential](https://modrinth.com/mod/glassential)!

(in all honesty it works in a kinda-hacky way but it should be fine ;) )
